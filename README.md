# POS-Tagging-using-HMM
In this notebook, different POS Taggers are built using HMM Model

## Different POS Tagger Built
- vanilla Viterbi based POS tagger
- Modify Viterbi Algorithm to handle unknown words
- Lexicon Unigram Tagger
- Regex Parser/ Rule Based Tagger
- Combining Regex Tagger with Unigram Tagger
- Combining Unigram Regex Tagger with Bigram Tagger
- Combining Bigram Regex Tagger with Trigram Tagger
- Modifying Viterbi with Trigram
- Viterbi Modification-Technique I : Viterbi Generic Heuristic without laplace smoothing, this does not use emission probabilty matrix prepared for test set
